TEACH THE BOT TO READ

If there are any TIF files in this folder, you need to read what is inside the image and then move the image to the folder with the same name.

This is easily done by viewing in Thumbnails view and then drag/drop the images into the folders.

Once the script reads a TIF file in a folder, it will convert it to a TXT file and the TIF will no longer be used.

The folder named "empty" is for anything that is not an action.  Basically all the blank images that build up here.
